# The-Best-Classifier
This repository includes the classification model built for final project submission in the course - Machine Learning with Python by IBM on coursera.  The dataset includes information on loan applications. Different classification algorithms have been used to build the models: k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression. The accuracy of each classifier is reported using Jaccard Index, F1-score, and LogLoss (wherever applicable).
